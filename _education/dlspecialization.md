The Coursera Deep Learning Specialization was a challenging but rewarding experience. I gained a strong foundation in neural networks, from theory to practical implementation. CNNs and RNNs were fascinating, though complex. Experimentation and hyperparameter tuning were key to success. While the course provided excellent theoretical knowledge, bridging the gap to real-world applications is my next step.
